# Production planning

As a football fan, I have always been fascinated by the industry surrounding this sport. With the upcoming Euro 2024, many businesses will face the challenge of producing various football-related items while opti- mizing their production processes. In light of this, I have undertaken a project to optimize the production of football equipment such as jerseys, football shoes, balls, shin pads, and goalkeeper gloves.
I am now the owner of a football equipment company and aim to optimize production for the upcoming month, either by maximizing profit, minimizing shortages or a compromise. Each equipment item can be produced in two different ways (Method 1 or Method 2) where each method requires different components. Additionally, there are three types of workers capable of producing specific equipment items. Each type of worker has varying productivity levels and salaries. Therefore, I need to hire the necessary number of work- ers for production. To ensure efficient production, I face several constraints, including demand constraints, supply constraints and worker constraints. These constraints must be carefully managed to achieve optimal production outcomes.
